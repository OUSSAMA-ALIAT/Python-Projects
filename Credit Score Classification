data = pd.read_csv("train.csv")
print(data.head())



Let’s have a look at the information about the columns in the dataset:

1
print(data.info())

Before moving forward, let’s have a look if the dataset has any null values or not:

print(data.isnull().sum())
1
print(data.isnull().sum())

The dataset doesn’t have any null values. As this dataset is labelled, let’s have a look at the Credit_Score column values:


data["Credit_Score"].value_counts()

Data Exploration
The dataset has many features that can train a Machine Learning model for credit score classification. Let’s explore all the features one by one.

I will start by exploring the occupation feature to know if the occupation of the person affects credit scores:

fig = px.box(data, 
             x="Occupation",  
             color="Credit_Score", 
             title="Credit Scores Based on Occupation", 
             color_discrete_map={'Poor':'red',
                                 'Standard':'yellow',
                                 'Good':'green'})
fig.show()

There’s not much difference in the credit scores of all occupations mentioned in the data. Now let’s explore whether the Annual Income of the person impacts your credit scores or not:

fig = px.box(data, 
             x="Credit_Score", 
             y="Annual_Income", 
             color="Credit_Score",
             title="Credit Scores Based on Annual Income", 
             color_discrete_map={'Poor':'red',
                                 'Standard':'yellow',
                                 'Good':'green'})
fig.update_traces(quartilemethod="exclusive")
fig.show()

According to the above visualization, the more you earn annually, the better your credit score is. Now let’s explore whether the monthly in-hand salary impacts credit scores or not:

fig = px.box(data, 
             x="Credit_Score", 
             y="Monthly_Inhand_Salary", 
             color="Credit_Score",
             title="Credit Scores Based on Monthly Inhand Salary", 
             color_discrete_map={'Poor':'red',
                                 'Standard':'yellow',
                                 'Good':'green'})
fig.update_traces(quartilemethod="exclusive")
fig.show()
